# Smell baseline

A fixed set of code smells (Martin Fowler, Refactoring, chapter 3) carried in every review intent file as the standards axis. Three rules bind it:

- The repo overrides. A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- Always a judgment call. Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation. Report the smell by name and quote the hunk.
- Skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads what it is, then the fix:

- **Mysterious Name**: a function, variable, or type whose name does not reveal what it does or holds. Rename it; if no honest name comes, the design is murky.
- **Duplicated Code**: the same logic shape in more than one hunk or file of the change. Extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy**: a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. Move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps**: the same few fields or parameters keep travelling together. Bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession**: a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. Give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches**: the same switch or if-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. Replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery**: one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. Gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change**: one file or module edited for several unrelated reasons. Split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality**: abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec does not have. Delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains**: long a.b().c().d() navigation the caller should not depend on. Hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man**: a class or function that mostly delegates onward. Cut it, call the real target directly.
- **Refused Bequest**: a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. Drop the inheritance, use composition.
